Music - Schema Critique Notes

ORIGINAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
- The original schema stored artists and producers as arrays, making queries and filtering more complex.

- All metadata (artists, producers, albums) was embedded directly in the `songs` table, leading to redundancy.

- There were no foreign key relationships to enforce data integrity.

- Seed data used inconsistent formatting and lacked normalization, limiting relational analysis.

GOALS FOR SEED DATA IMPROVEMENT:
- Normalize artists, albums, and producers into separate tables to support relational design.

- Create many-to-many relationships for artists and producers to accurately reflect real-world music collaborations.

- Seed the database with diverse, recognizable data spanning decades and genres.

- Support complex queries (e.g. all songs by a producer, all songs on an album, collaborations between artists).

SCHEMA IMPROVEMENTS MADE:
- Artists, producers, and albums now have their own tables for better normalization and reuse.

- Songs are linked via foreign keys to albums.

- Many-to-many join tables were created for song-to-artist and song-to-producer relationships.

- Seed data now reflects real-world relationships between entities and avoids repetition.

FILE BREAKDOWN:
- TABLES:
  * `artist`: 15 artists
  * `producer`: 13 producers
  * `album`: 10 albums
  * `song`: 10 songs
  * `song_artist`
  * `song_producer`
    -* All songs mapped to their respective artists and producers
- Design enables filtering by artist, producer, album, or time range.

POTENTIAL FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
- Add genre classification and track numbers.

- Track chart performance or awards data.

- Create views for “top collaborations” or “songs with most producers.”

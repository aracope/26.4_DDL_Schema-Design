Outer Space - Schema Critique Notes

ORIGINAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
- Moons were stored as a TEXT[] array, which breaks normalization and limits future scalability.

- Planets table included galaxy and orbital relationships as plain text, which could cause inconsistency or duplication across entries.

SCHEMA IMPROVEMENTS MADE:
- Created a moons table with a foreign key referencing planets. This allows better tracking and avoids array limitations.

- Created a stars table to represent the object each planet orbits around. This normalizes the "orbits_around" field.

- Created a galaxies table to normalize the galaxy data and allow linking multiple stars or planets to one galaxy.

FILE BREAKDOWN:
- outer_space_ddl.sql: Contains all CREATE TABLE statements for the improved schema.

- outer_space_improved_seed.sql: Contains seed data for galaxies, stars, planets, and moons.

- outer_space_original.sql: Original file provided for comparison.

- notes.txt: This file! Summarizes changes and rationale.

POTENTIAL FUTURE ENAHANCEMENTS:
- Add fields like mass, radius, or atmospheric composition to planets.

- Link stars to galaxies with more detailed star data (type, temperature, etc...).

- Include a planet_type table (e.g., terrestrial, gas giant, etc...).
